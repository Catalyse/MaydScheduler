# Mayd Scheduler -- Based in Unity
The Mayd Scheduler is a program that is being designed for a 2 shift system, but once further into its development will be able to handle any kind of scheduling.
The information the program will take various heavily depending on how one wants to process their schedule generation.
Initially schedules will be produced based on employee availability and the skill levels of the employees that are available as defined by the user.

As the program progresses I plan to make it more adaptable to various scheduling needs, depending on the needs of those using it.

Initially it is being designed for an open close only style schedule, but has elements embedded for allowing larger shift work.

#Current Project Status
>As of mid 2016, the production of this version of the project was discontinued.
>The focus and a large portion of the code for this project was migrated to an android application based in Xamarin.
>The project is FUNCTIONAL as of its last commit, though it hasn't been maintained since the transition to Xamarin.

This project was found to be better suited as a mobile application, though the mobile application is modeled directly after this version and maintains the same run style.
