# VerizonScheduler
The VerizonScheduler is a program that is being designed for Verizon Wireless, but once further in its development it will be meant to help with any given scheduling problem.
The information the program will take various heavily depending on how one wants to process their schedule generation.
Inititally schedules will be produced based on employee availability and the skill levels of the employees that are available as defined by the user.

As the program progresses I plan to make it more adaptable to various scheduling needs, depending on the needs of those using it.

Initially it is being designed for an open close only style schedule, but has elements embedded for allowing larger shift work.
